```bash
□ Create Google Doc: "UBIT Analysis - Every Revenue Stream"
□ For EACH revenue idea, document:
  - Description
  - Price point
  - Target audience
  - Frequency
  - Substantial relation to mission (or not)
  - Tax exposure (assume 35%)
□ Share with CPA and board
□ Get written CPA opinion
```text

**Reality Check**:

## Hour 25-48: Technical Hardening (by 3:51 AM day after tomorrow)

  rm .env

□ Set up nightly diff monitoring:
  crontab -e
  0 2 * * * diff ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.backup | mail -s "Config Drift Alert" you@email.com

□ Print paper backup of:
  - All configs
  - All scripts
  - API key locations (not values)
  - Manual recovery commands

□ Test "break-glass" scenario:
  - Delete all configs
  - Recover from paper only
  - Time the recovery
```text

**Script Half-Life**: Days, not weeks. Oh My Zsh update = instant alias death.

## Hour 49-72: Cash Flow Reality Dashboard

```bash
□ Create spreadsheet with:
  - Daily bank balance
  - Days of runway remaining
  - Burn rate (assume $3,500/month minimum)
