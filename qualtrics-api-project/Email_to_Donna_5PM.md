Hi Donna,

Following up from our meeting, I'm excited to share the pilot materials for the WFD data culture transformation:

**1. Manager Assessment Survey (LIVE NOW)**  
The manager assessment is now live at [INSERT QUALTRICS LINK]. As you requested, it uses the validated ORIC-12 instrument plus additional questions about current data practices. Skip logic ensures Community Services managers don't see Interim Housing questions and vice versa. All responses feed directly into the dashboard for real-time readiness tracking.

**2. Real-Time Dashboard Preview**  
[Dashboard link] - This prototype shows how manager survey responses will automatically populate organizational readiness scores, identify gaps in data practices, and track progress over time.

**3. August 13 Data Club Materials**  
- Pre-session survey results summary (will be ready August 12)
- Interactive workshop agenda focused on the "two buckets" you mentioned
- Manager-specific data guides for Community Services vs Interim Housing

**Key Features Implemented:**
✓ ORIC-12 validated measurement (Shea et al., 2014)
✓ Program-specific pathways (Community Services vs Interim Housing)  
✓ Automatic dashboard integration via API
✓ Anonymous responses to encourage honest feedback
✓ Real-time readiness scoring

**What Happens Next:**
1. Managers complete survey by August 5 (1 week)
2. I'll analyze results and prepare insights by August 12
3. Present findings at August 13 Data Club session
4. Begin weekly dashboard usage tracking

**Baseline Metrics We'll Capture:**
- Organizational readiness scores (via ORIC-12)
- Current data usage frequency ("Right now they don't use any data")
- Confidence levels with data interpretation
- Program-specific pain points and needs

This gives us the pre-intervention baseline you need for the case study, with validated metrics suitable for academic publication. The API integration ensures we can track behavioral changes in real-time as managers begin using the dashboard.

Would you like me to send the survey link directly to the managers, or would you prefer to distribute it with your introduction?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. The survey takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. I tested both paths (Community Services and Interim Housing) to ensure the skip logic works perfectly.
