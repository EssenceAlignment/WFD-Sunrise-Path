# Re-add to .zshrc manually
echo 'alias recovery-setup="source ~/.recovery_compass_setup.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'alias fix-mcp="~/.fix_mcp.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Compliance Emergency
```

2. Call nonprofit attorney
3. Document everything
4. Prepare for audit
5. Notify insurance carrier
```

```

### Funding Sources (Ranked by Reality)
1. **Your savings** (100% reliable)
2. **Board giving** (75% reliable)
3. **Friends/family** (50% reliable)
4. **Local foundations** (10% chance)
5. **Earned revenue** (UBIT nightmare)

## üéØ The Brutal Truth

**Year 1**: You'll lose money. Budget for it.
**Year 2**: You might break even. Maybe.
**Year 3**: Sustainable if you survive.
**Year 5**: Growth possible. Not guaranteed.

**Failure points**:
- 30% fail by Year 10 (sector average)
- 50% of those fail on compliance
- 30% fail on cash flow
