# Recovery Compass 501(c)(3) Compliance & Revenue Guide

## Executive Summary

With 501(c)(3) approval, Recovery Compass must balance mission-driven revenue generation with IRS compliance. This guide ensures all earned revenue strategies amplify rather than jeopardize tax-exempt status.

## 🚨 Critical Compliance Framework

### Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT) Guidelines

**Key Rule**: Revenue from "trade or business, regularly carried on, not substantially related" to exempt mission = taxable UBI

**Safe Harbor Strategies**:

1. **ERD Certification**: Document explicit charitable/educational goals in every syllabus
2. **Corporate Workshops**: Frame as "training social-service leaders" not generic performance
3. **Newsletter**: Keep ads <10% of content, maintain educational focus
4. **Trigger**: $1,000+ gross unrelated income → File Form 990-T

**Red Flag**: Generic corporate coaching → Create for-profit subsidiary

### Mission-Related Revenue (Tax-Exempt)

✅ **Clearly Mission-Related**:

- ERD methodology training for recovery professionals
- Educational workshops on environmental response design
- Research-based newsletters advancing addiction science
- Certification programs improving treatment outcomes

❌ **Potentially Unrelated**:

- Generic corporate wellness programs
- Lifestyle content subscriptions
- Ad-heavy publications
- Non-recovery consulting services
