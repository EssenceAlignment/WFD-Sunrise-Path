# ðŸš¨ Security Incident Postmortem - August 2025

## Executive Summary
On August 1, 2025, multiple API keys and authentication tokens were inadvertently exposed in a chat session. This postmortem documents the incident, immediate response, and long-term mitigations implemented.

## Timeline
- **14:25 PST**: Credentials shared in chat context
- **14:35 PST**: Risk identified and containment initiated
- **14:37 PST**: Credential rotation process began
- **15:00 PST**: All exposed credentials rotated (target)

## Exposed Credentials
### Critical (Immediate Rotation Required)
- Supabase Service Role Key
- OpenAI API Key (sk-proj-*)
- Anthropic API Key (sk-ant-*)
- GitHub Personal Access Tokens (2)
- Docker Hub Token
- Airtable API Key
- Linear API Key
- Perplexity API Key

### Non-Critical (Public by Design)
- Firebase Web API Key
- Supabase URL
- Supabase Anon Key
- Firebase Project Configuration

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Primary Cause**: Copy-paste of configuration data without sanitization
2. **Contributing Factors**:
   - Lack of pre-paste credential scanning
   - No established SOP for sharing configuration examples
   - Mixed storage of public and private keys

## Immediate Actions Taken
1. âœ… Backed up existing .env files
2. âœ… Created credential inventory
3. âœ… Initiated systematic rotation
4. âœ… Implemented secure storage strategy
5. âœ… Scanned git history for leaks

## Long-Term Mitigations
### Technical Controls
1. **Keychain Storage**: All admin tokens in macOS Keychain
2. **Cloudflare Secrets**: Production app secrets in Workers
3. **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit scanning with gitleaks
4. **Automated Rotation**: Quarterly key rotation reminders

### Process Controls
1. **Credential Handling SOP**: Never paste raw credentials
2. **Configuration Templates**: Use placeholder values
3. **Security Reviews**: Monthly credential audits
4. **Training**: Team briefing on secure practices

## Storage Architecture

```

## Verification Steps
- [ ] All exposed credentials rotated
- [ ] New credentials stored securely
- [ ] Services operational with new credentials
- [ ] Git history sanitized
- [ ] Team notified of changes

## Lessons Learned
1. **Always sanitize** before sharing configuration
2. **Separate concerns**: Public vs private configuration
3. **Automate scanning**: Use tools to prevent accidents
4. **Document everything**: Clear SOPs prevent mistakes

## Prevention Metrics
- Time to Detection: 10 minutes
- Time to Containment: 2 minutes
- Time to Resolution: 35 minutes (target)
- Services Affected: 0 (proactive rotation)

## Sign-Off
- Incident Lead: Eric Jones
- Date: August 1, 2025
- Status: Resolved
