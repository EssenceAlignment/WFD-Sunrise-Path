# Recovery Compass 501(c)(3) Risk-Aware Strategy

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Executive Reality Check

The original "Compliance-Protected Growth Strategy" assumes best-case scenarios. This document provides the sobering counterweight: what will likely go wrong, what it will cost, and how to survive anyway.

## üö® Critical Risks & Mitigation

### 1. IRS Revocation Risk (28,000 charities lost status last year)

**Reality**: You're in the highest-risk category - new, small, ambitious.

**Mitigation Protocol**:

```
- Set 990 deadlines 60 days early with board backup
- Monthly compliance checklist reviewed by 2 board members
- Quarterly CPA review of all revenue classifications
- Annual mock IRS audit with outside counsel
- Budget: $15,000/year minimum for compliance
```

### 2. UBIT Landmines

**Reality**: Your ERD Certification at $2,500 is presumptively commercial.

**Immediate Actions**:

```
1. File Form 990-T preemptively (even if under $1,000)
2. Document "substantial public benefit" for every program
3. Price at or below market comparables
4. Open enrollment (no exclusivity)
5. Budget: 35% of gross unrelated income for taxes
```

**Revenue Stream Risk Matrix**:

| Stream | UBIT Risk | Mitigation Required | True Net Margin |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| ERD Certification | HIGH | Open enrollment, cost-basis pricing | 15-20% |
| Monthly Giving | NONE | Standard acknowledgments | 85-90% |
| Newsletter Ads | MEDIUM | <10% space, mission-aligned only | 40-50% |
| Corporate Workshops | VERY HIGH | Subsidiary or avoid | 0-10% |
| API Licensing | EXTREME | For-profit subsidiary required | Unknown |

### 3. California AG Compliance

**Reality**: One missed filing = public "Delinquent" status

**Compliance Calendar**:

```
- Day 1-30: File CT-1 (Initial Registration)
- Month 4: RRF-1 (Annual Registration)
- Month 11: SI-100 (Solicitation Permit)
- Ongoing: Update within 30 days of any change
- Budget: $5,000/year for CA compliance alone
```

### 4. Grant Reality Check

**Success Rates**:

- Foundation grants: 10%
- Federal grants: 3-5%
- Time per application: 20-100 hours
- Break-even: Apply only if grant > $50,000

**Realistic Grant Strategy**:

```
Year 1: 0 federal grants (build track record)
Year 1: 2-3 local foundations ($10-25K each)
Year 2: 1 federal planning grant
Year 3: Major federal implementation grant
Total Year 1 grant revenue: $30,000 (not $200,000)
```

### 5. Revenue Projections vs Reality

**Original Projection**: $0 ‚Üí $500K in 12 months

**Risk-Adjusted Projection**:

```
Q1 2025: $5,000 (friends & family)
Q2 2025: $15,000 (early donors + 1 workshop)
Q3 2025: $25,000 (small foundation grant)
Q4 2025: $35,000 (year-end giving)
Total Year 1: $80,000 (not $500,000)
```

**Survival Revenue Model**:

- 60% Individual donations (most reliable)
- 30% Foundation grants (relationship-based)
- 10% Earned revenue (UBIT-compliant only)
- 0% Government grants (Year 1)

### 6. True Cost Structure

**Realistic Overhead**:

```
Compliance & Legal: 20%
Admin & Operations: 15%
Fundraising: 20%
Technology: 10%
Insurance & Risk: 5%
Total Overhead: 70% (Year 1)
```

**This means**: Every $100 raised delivers $30 to programs.

### 7. Board Liability Protection

**California Director Exposure**: Personal liability for compliance failures

**Required Protection**:

```
1. D&O Insurance: $1M minimum ($3,000/year)
2. Monthly compliance attestations
3. Documented deliberation (no rubber stamps)
4. Independent audit by Year 2
5. Board training on fiduciary duty
```

### 8. Mission Drift Prevention

**Risk**: "Environmental behavioral infrastructure" confuses everyone

**Mission Discipline**:

```
Original: Addiction recovery through environmental design
Fundable: Evidence-based recovery housing programs
NOT: Generic wellness or productivity consulting
Test: Can a donor explain your mission in one sentence?
```

## üìä Survival Metrics (Not Vanity Metrics)

Track these monthly:

1. **Months of Cash Runway** (target: 6+)
2. **Compliance Checklist Completion** (target: 100%)
3. **Donor Retention Rate** (sector average: 45%)
4. **Cost per Dollar Raised** (target: <$0.50 by Year 2)
5. **Days Since Last IRS/AG Filing** (target: always current)

## üéØ Year 1 Survival Priorities

### Do This

1. **Raise $100K unrestricted** (individuals + family foundations)
2. **File every form early** (990, CT-1, RRF-1)
3. **Document everything** (board minutes, UBIT analysis)
4. **Build one perfect program** (provable outcomes)
5. **Retain one great CPA** (nonprofit specialist)

### Don't Do This

1. Chase federal grants (too early)
2. Launch earned revenue without UBIT analysis
3. Promise specific outcomes to funders
4. Hire full-time staff (contractors only)
5. Believe your own hype

## üí∞ Realistic Financial Plan

### Year 1 Budget (Survival Mode)

```
REVENUE
Individual Giving:      $50,000
Foundation Grants:      $30,000
Earned Revenue (safe):  $20,000
Total Revenue:         $100,000

EXPENSES
Programs (30%):         $30,000
Compliance/Legal:       $20,000
Operations/Admin:       $15,000
Fundraising:           $20,000
Technology:            $10,000
Reserve:                $5,000
Total Expenses:        $100,000
```

### Year 2-3 Growth Path

- Year 2: $250,000 (add federal planning grant)
- Year 3: $500,000 (add major implementation grant)
- Year 5: $1,000,000 (proven model, diverse revenue)

## üö® Kill Switches (When to Pivot or Shut Down)

1. **Cash < 3 months runway** ‚Üí Immediate fundraising focus
2. **IRS inquiry** ‚Üí Stop everything, get counsel
3. **Donor retention < 30%** ‚Üí Program model broken
4. **Board resignation** ‚Üí Governance crisis
5. **Negative press** ‚Üí Crisis communications plan

## ‚úÖ Monthly Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Bank reconciliation complete
- [ ] Donor acknowledgments sent (within 5 days)
- [ ] Board meeting minutes filed
- [ ] Insurance premiums current
- [ ] Payroll taxes deposited
- [ ] CA AG account checked
- [ ] SAM.gov registration valid
- [ ] UBIT revenue tracked
- [ ] Restricted funds properly allocated
- [ ] Conflict of interest forms current

## üéØ The Bottom Line

**Original Strategy**: $0 ‚Üí $10M in 24 months
**Reality**: $0 ‚Üí $100K ‚Üí $500K ‚Üí $1M over 3-5 years

**Success requires**:

- Paranoid compliance discipline
- Conservative revenue projections  
- Aggressive expense management
- Patient capital (unrestricted gifts)
- Board members who understand risk

**The harsh truth**: Most new nonprofits fail. The ones that survive are paranoid about compliance, conservative about revenue, and patient about growth. Be one of those.
