schedule:
  - cron: '*/15 * * * *'  # Every 15 minutes instead of 5
```
- **New monthly usage: 1,490 minutes**

### Option 3: Smart Scheduling
Run more frequently during business hours:
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '*/5 8-18 * * 1-5'   # Every 5 min, Mon-Fri, 8am-6pm
  - cron: '0 */2 * * 0,6'      # Every 2 hours on weekends
```

- **Still fits in FREE tier!**

### Option 4: Event-Driven Only
Remove schedule, only trigger on PR events:
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, ready_for_review]
  workflow_dispatch:
  # Remove schedule completely
```
- **Monthly usage: <100 minutes**
- **Near zero cost**

## ðŸš€ Recommended Approach:

### For Maximum Automation (Current Setup):
1. If repo is PUBLIC â†’ **$0/month forever**
2. If repo is PRIVATE â†’ Need GitHub Pro ($4/month) or optimize schedule

### For Free Tier (Private Repo):
```yaml
# Update .github/workflows/automated-pr-optimization.yml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, ready_for_review]
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/15 8-20 * * *'  # Every 15 min, 8am-8pm daily
  workflow_dispatch:
```
This gives you:
- 48 runs/day during active hours
- ~720 minutes/month
- **Well within FREE tier!**
- Still catches PR #2 within 15 minutes max
