# Recovery Compass Docker Implementation Readiness Assessment

## Date: July 30, 2025

### Gate 1: Secret-Management Baseline ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ GitHub Secret Scanning enabled (per SECURITY_FEATURES_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
- ‚úÖ CodeQL security analysis active (security.yml)
- ‚úÖ Push protection enabled to block secret commits
- ‚úÖ Trivy scanning configured (docker-security.yml)
- ‚úÖ Runtime secret mounting strategy documented (SECRETS_MANAGEMENT.md)
- ‚úÖ `.env.secrets.example` template created
- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` updated to exclude secrets

**Completed Actions:**
1. ‚úÖ Added Trivy scanning workflow
2. ‚úÖ Created comprehensive secrets documentation
3. ‚úÖ Implemented secret template and gitignore rules

---

### Gate 2: Compose-File Contract Approved ‚úÖ DOCUMENTED

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Service port allocations defined (SERVICE_CONTRACTS.md)
- ‚úÖ Health check standards established
- ‚úÖ Environment variable contracts documented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è docker-compose.yml not yet created (pending Gate 5 decision)

**Completed Actions:**
1. ‚úÖ Defined all service port allocations
2. ‚úÖ Documented health check endpoints and protocols
3. ‚úÖ Created comprehensive environment variable contracts
4. ‚úÖ Mapped inter-service communication patterns
5. ‚úÖ Defined volume mounts and network boundaries

**Pending:** Team approval checkboxes in SERVICE_CONTRACTS.md

---

### Gate 3: Dev ‚Üî CI ‚Üî Prod Parity Script ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions infrastructure exists
- ‚úÖ Docker Compose CI workflow created (.github/workflows/docker-compose-ci.yml)
- ‚úÖ Makefile created with standardized commands
- ‚úÖ Services tested locally and confirmed healthy

**Completed Actions:**
1. ‚úÖ Created comprehensive Makefile with `make up`, `make test`, etc.
2. ‚úÖ Added docker-compose-ci.yml workflow that:
   - Runs on fresh Ubuntu runner
   - Creates minimal env files
   - Starts services with `docker compose up -d`
   - Verifies health with `pg_isready` and `redis-cli ping`
   - Validates containers are running
3. ‚úÖ Verified locally: Both postgres and redis are healthy

**Evidence:**
- Local test: `docker exec recovery-compass-postgres pg_isready` ‚Üí "accepting connections"
- Local test: `docker exec recovery-compass-redis redis-cli -a changeme ping` ‚Üí "PONG"

---

### Gate 4: Migration Path to Kubernetes ‚úÖ CI VALIDATION READY

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Kompose validation job added to CI workflow
- ‚úÖ Local test script created (test-kompose.sh)
- ‚úÖ CI will install Kompose v1.31.2 and convert compose files
- ‚úÖ Artifacts will be uploaded for review

**Completed Actions:**
1. ‚úÖ Added `kompose-validation` job to docker-compose-ci.yml
2. ‚úÖ CI workflow will:
   - Install Kompose on fresh runner
   - Convert docker-compose.minimal.yml to k8s manifests
   - List and display all generated YAML files
   - Upload manifests as GitHub Actions artifacts
   - Validate YAML syntax
3. ‚úÖ Created test-kompose.sh for local testing

**Note:** Kompose not installed locally, but CI handles this automatically

---

### Gate 5: Repository Topology ‚úÖ DECIDED

**Current Status:**
- üìç Current location: `/Users/ericjones/Projects/wfd-sunrise-path/WFD-Sunrise-Path`
- ‚úÖ Decision made: Subdirectory approach (recovery-compass-docker/)
- ‚úÖ Decision documented (REPOSITORY_TOPOLOGY_DECISION.md)
- ‚úÖ No submodule complexity needed

**Completed Actions:**
1. ‚úÖ Analyzed both options with pros/cons
2. ‚úÖ Selected subdirectory approach for force multiplication
3. ‚úÖ Documented implementation plan

---

## Recommendation: PROCEED WITH CAUTION

### Immediate Actions Before Implementation:

1. **Secret Management (30 minutes)**
   - Add Trivy to security workflow
   - Create secret handling documentation

2. **Service Contracts (1 hour)**
   - Define all port allocations
   - Document environment variables
   - Get team agreement on interfaces

3. **Repository Decision (15 minutes)**
   - Choose location for docker stack
   - Set up structure

### Implementation Plan:

**Phase 0: Foundation (Today)**
- Complete gates 1, 2, and 5
- Create base directory structure
- Set up Trivy scanning

**Phase 1: Architecture (Tomorrow)**
- Create docker-compose.yml
- Add Makefile
- Test basic services

**Phase 2: CI Integration (Day 3)**
- Add compose to GitHub Actions
- Verify parity
- Test Kompose conversion

**Phase 3: Security Hardening (Day 4)**
- Implement secret mounting
- Add vulnerability scanning
- Document compliance

## Gate Status Summary

| Gate | Status | Blocking? | Action Required |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1. Secret Management | ‚úÖ COMPLETE | No | Done |
| 2. Compose Contract | ‚úÖ DOCUMENTED | No | Await team approval |
| 3. Dev/CI Parity | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | No | Can add after compose exists |
| 4. Kubernetes Path | ‚ùå NOT TESTED | No | Test after compose exists |
| 5. Repo Topology | ‚úÖ DECIDED | No | Subdirectory approach selected |

## ‚è≥ PENDING CI VALIDATION

**Gates 3 & 4 Implementation Complete - Awaiting CI Run**

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Gate 1: Secret management complete
- ‚úÖ Gate 2: Service contracts documented
- ‚úÖ Gate 3: CI workflow created - **needs first run for proof**
- ‚úÖ Gate 4: Kompose job created - **needs first run for proof**
- ‚úÖ Gate 5: Repository topology decided

### Evidence Required Before Proceeding:
1. **Push this PR** to trigger the docker-compose-ci.yml workflow
2. **Verify CI passes** with green checkmarks for both jobs:
   - `docker-compose-test`: Proves fresh runner parity
   - `kompose-validation`: Proves Kubernetes migration path
3. **Review artifacts** from the kompose-validation job

### What the CI Will Prove:
- Docker services start cleanly on Ubuntu runner (not just local Mac)
- Health checks pass in CI environment
- Kompose successfully converts compose files without fatal errors
- Generated Kubernetes manifests are valid YAML

### Clone Instructions:
- ‚úÖ Documented in CLONE_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- ‚úÖ No submodule complexity
- ‚úÖ Sparse checkout option for partners

### Secret Handling:
- ‚úÖ Charity Navigator credentials removed from .env.secrets.example
- ‚úÖ Note added to use CI/CD secrets instead
- ‚úÖ Trivy scanning configured

**Next Step:** Push these changes to trigger CI validation, then review the workflow results.
