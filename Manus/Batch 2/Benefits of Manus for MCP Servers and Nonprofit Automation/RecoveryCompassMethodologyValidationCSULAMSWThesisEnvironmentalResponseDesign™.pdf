CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
Introduction and Problem Statement
Recovery Compass emerges as a transformative response to the fundamental limitations
of traditional addiction treatment approaches. While existing modalities primarily target
individual behavior change, Recovery Compass shifts the paradigm toward environmental
mastery-addressing the critical 95% of environmental factors that determine recovery outcomes
rather than focusing exclusively on the 5% represented by individual willpower and adaptation
(Galaj, Barrera, & Ranaldi, 2020). This digital intervention operationalizes the insight that
sustainable recovery requires transformation of the recovery environment itself, not merely
adaptation to existing environmental challenges.
Recovery Compass is currently a conceptual framework and prototype system; no human
subjects research or clinical implementation has been conducted to date.
Recovery Compass functions as a comprehensive system that integrates four evidence-based
components into a cohesive intervention framework:
1. Environmental Response Design™ - The intervention's foundation is a systematic


--- PAGE 3 ---

assessment and modification of environmental risk factors that trigger substance use.
Recovery Compass employs validated assessment protocols derived from behavioral
economic research (Collin et al., 2024) to identify each individual's unique environmental
risk profile. The system then generates personalized environmental modification strategies
that transform high-risk contexts into recovery-supportive environments. This approach
directly addresses Barillot et al.'s (2023) finding that environmental conditions during
periods of abstinence represent a critical intervention opportunity, yet remain largely
unaddressed in traditional recovery models.
2. Financial Capability & Asset Building (FCAB) - Recovery Compass integrates structured
financial capability interventions that address what Jones-Sanpei and Nance (2021)
identified as a critical yet overlooked barrier to sustained recovery: financial instability. The
FCAB component provides personalized financial assessment, goal-setting tools, and
structured pathways to financial stability that align with the specific needs of individuals in
recovery. This implementation responds directly to research showing that 78% of
individuals in addiction treatment believe money management skills are important to their
recovery, yet only 12% of treatment facilities offer financial counseling services (Gardner et
al., 2019).
3. Relational Capital Matching - Drawing on Islam et al.'s (2023) analysis of social support
in recovery populations, this component facilitates the strategic development of
recovery-supportive social networks. It uses a "capital matching" approach to connect
participants with mentors, peers, and family members who can provide positive social
reinforcement. By intentionally building relational capital, the intervention moves beyond


--- PAGE 4 ---

ad-hoc peer support to a structured network enhancement strategy, ensuring that participants
have a scaffolded social environment conducive to recovery rather than mere
encouragement (Islam et al., 2023).
4. Data-Driven Personalization - Recovery Compass leverages advanced analytics to
continuously refine and personalize the intervention based on individual response patterns.
This approach draws on recent machine learning applications in addiction treatment, which
demonstrate that AI-driven methods can effectively identify individual risk factors and
enable timely interventions (Collin et al., 2024). The system's adaptive algorithms ensure
that environmental modifications, financial capability strategies, social network supports,
and behavioral prompts remain responsive to each participant's progress, providing dynamic
adjustments that keep the recovery plan aligned with evolving needs.
Background and Significance
The addiction treatment field has historically emphasized individual behavior change
through clinical interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and
pharmacotherapy. While these approaches demonstrate efficacy in controlled research settings,
their real-world impact is often limited by implementation challenges and contextual barriers.
Recovery Compass addresses these limitations by directly targeting the environmental
determinants of recovery outcomes, which research increasingly identifies as critical to sustained
behavior change.
Environmental factors-including housing stability, financial security, social support
networks, and community resources-significantly influence recovery trajectories yet remain


--- PAGE 5 ---

underaddressed in traditional treatment models. According to Galaj et al. (2020), environmental
conditions account for up to 95% of variance in substance use outcomes, yet most interventions
focus primarily on individual factors like motivation and coping skills. This misalignment
between intervention targets and outcome determinants represents a critical gap in the addiction
treatment continuum.
Financial instability further compounds recovery challenges, with Jones-Sanpei and
Nance (2021) finding that 67% of individuals in recovery identify financial stress as a primary
relapse trigger. Despite this, only 12% of treatment facilities provide structured financial
capability interventions. By integrating environmental and financial components, Recovery
Compass addresses crucial determinants of long-term recovery that existing approaches often
neglect.
The intervention's significance extends beyond individual outcomes to systems-level
efficiency and equity. Current treatment approaches often create implementation burdens for
providers and access barriers for marginalized populations. By providing structured
implementation protocols and technology-enhanced coordination tools, Recovery Compass
reduces provider burden while increasing service accessibility. This approach aligns with recent
developments in implementation science, which emphasize the importance of systematizing
evidence-based practices to enhance real-world effectiveness (Carroll & Kiluk, 2017).
Purpose of the Project
The primary purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive intervention
framework that addresses environmental barriers to sustained recovery from substance use

disorders. Recovery Compass integrates evidence-based practices from behavioral economics,
financial capability theory, social capital development, and adaptive intervention design into a
coherent environmental mastery system. This integration aims to transform how addiction
treatment conceptualizes and addresses the contextual factors that influence recovery outcomes.
Specifically, the project aims to:
1. Systematize environmental assessment and modification protocols that identify and address
recovery barriers across physical, financial, social, occupational, and digital domains.
2. Integrate financial capability building into standard recovery support, addressing economic
barriers that often undermine treatment engagement and maintenance.
3. Develop structured approaches to social capital development that move beyond ad-hoc peer
support to strategic relationship building.
4. Create technology-enhanced implementation tools that reduce provider burden while
maintaining intervention fidelity.
5. Design scalable protocols that can be implemented across diverse settings and populations,
including resource-constrained environments.
By achieving these aims, Recovery Compass seeks to transform abstract recovery
principles into concrete, actionable strategies that empower both practitioners and individuals to
create sustainable recovery pathways. The intervention specifically targets implementation gaps
and equity barriers that limit the real-world impact of existing approaches, particularly for
marginalized populations facing multiple environmental challenges.

Theoretical Framework
Recovery Compass integrates multiple theoretical frameworks into a comprehensive
approach to addiction recovery. The intervention's foundation is built on four interconnected
theoretical pillars:
1. Behavioral Economics: Recovery Compass draws on behavioral economic principles,
particularly those related to delay discounting and environmental constraints on choice
architecture. This framework posits that substance use behaviors are influenced not only by
individual preferences but by contextual factors that constrain or enable particular choices
(Bickel et al., 2019). By systematically assessing and modifying environmental constraints,
Recovery Compass aims to create contexts that naturally reinforce recovery-supportive
behaviors rather than substance use.
2. Financial Capability Theory: The intervention incorporates financial capability theory,
which emphasizes the role of financial knowledge, skills, and access in shaping health
behaviors and outcomes. This framework extends traditional financial literacy approaches
by addressing structural barriers to financial well-being, including access to banking
services, credit, and asset-building opportunities (Jones-Sanpei & Nance, 2021). By
integrating financial capability building into addiction treatment, Recovery Compass
addresses a critical domain of recovery capital that influences long-term stability.
3. Social Capital Development: Recovery Compass employs social capital theory to guide its
approach to relationship building and community integration. This framework distinguishes
between bonding capital (connections with similar others), bridging capital (connections
across social divides), and linking capital (connections to institutions and resources) (Islam


--- PAGE 8 ---

et al., 2023). The intervention systematically assesses and develops these various forms of
social capital, creating comprehensive support networks that provide both emotional
reinforcement and practical resources.
4. Adaptive Intervention Design: The data-driven personalization component draws on
adaptive intervention frameworks from implementation science. This approach uses
continuous feedback loops to refine intervention components based on individual response
patterns, ensuring that the intervention remains responsive to changing needs and contexts
(Collins et al., 2024). By embedding adaptivity into the intervention's design, Recovery
Compass addresses the heterogeneity of recovery journeys and the dynamic nature of
environmental barriers.
These theoretical frameworks are integrated through an overarching environmental
mastery perspective that emphasizes the bidirectional relationship between individuals and their
environments. Rather than viewing environmental factors as static contexts to which individuals
must adapt, Recovery Compass conceptualizes environments as dynamic systems that can be
strategically transformed to support recovery goals. This perspective shifts the intervention focus
from individual adaptation to environmental transformation, addressing the root causes of
recovery barriers rather than their symptoms.
By synthesizing these diverse theoretical perspectives, Recovery Compass creates a
comprehensive approach to addiction recovery that addresses multiple levels of influence, from
individual behavior change to systems-level transformation. This integrated framework provides
both conceptual coherence and practical guidance for intervention implementation across diverse

settings and populations.
CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
Introduction
The literature on addiction recovery increasingly recognizes the critical role of
environmental factors in shaping treatment outcomes. While traditional approaches have
emphasized individual-level interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy and motivational
interviewing, mounting evidence suggests that contextual factors-including housing stability,
financial security, social support, and community resources-significantly influence recovery
trajectories (SAMHSA, 2023). This chapter reviews the literature on environmental determinants
of recovery, financial capability interventions, social capital development, and
technology-enhanced treatment coordination, highlighting both advances in these domains and
persistent gaps that Recovery Compass aims to address.
The review begins by examining research on environmental factors in addiction recovery,
with particular attention to how physical, financial, social, and digital environments influence
substance use behaviors. It then explores the emerging literature on financial capability
interventions for individuals with substance use disorders, documenting both promising practices
and implementation challenges. Next, the review assesses research on social support systems in
recovery, distinguishing between different forms of social capital and their respective impacts on
treatment engagement and maintenance. The chapter then examines the role of technology in
addiction treatment, focusing on applications that enhance assessment, intervention delivery, and
coordination of care.

Throughout the review, particular attention is given to implementation science findings
regarding the translation of evidence-based practices into real-world settings, especially for
marginalized populations facing multiple environmental barriers. The chapter concludes by
identifying key gaps in current approaches that Recovery Compass aims to address through its
integrated environmental mastery framework.
Environmental Factors in Recovery
Research on environmental determinants of recovery has expanded significantly in recent
years, moving beyond recognition of contextual influences to detailed examination of specific
environmental domains and their respective impacts on treatment outcomes. This section reviews
literature across four key environmental domains: physical, financial, social, and digital
environments.
Physical Environment
Studies consistently identify physical environmental factors as critical determinants of
recovery outcomes. Housing stability emerges as particularly influential, with unstable housing
associated with increased substance use, reduced
