The Context Management Endpoints have been successfully implemented, tested, and documented according to the plan. This includes:

*   **Schema Definitions:** `app/schemas.py` now contains `EnvironmentDefinition`, `ContextCreationRequest`, `ContextCreationResponse`, `ContextUpdateRequest`, `ContextUpdateResponse`, and `ContextDetailsResponse` models.
*   **API Implementation:** `app/main.py` includes `POST /context/create`, `PUT /context/{contextId}`, and `GET /context/{contextId}` endpoints with in-memory storage and error handling.
*   **Testing Strategy:** `app/tests/test_context_management.py` provides comprehensive test coverage for the new endpoints.
*   **Documentation:** `README_CONTEXT.md` details the endpoints, request/response structures, and examples.

Considering the overall strategic integration plan for Recovery Compass, which aims to leverage Cline AI as a central orchestrator for Multi-Context Processing (MCP) servers and enhance pattern recognition, force multiplication, compounding value, and blind-spot catching prowess, what is the next logical development step for the Cline AI Service API? Please propose a concrete, actionable plan for the next phase of development, adhering to Gold-Plated IPE standards.
