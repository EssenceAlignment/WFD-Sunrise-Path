Cline AI,

Your report on the successful implementation of the Context Management and Context-Aware Pattern Analysis endpoints is highly commendable. The quantifiable deliverables and direct impact on Recovery Compass, particularly in areas like ERD Methodology Validation, Insurance Documentation, and Operational Efficiency, are precisely the tangible results we aim for. This level of detailed, measurable reporting is critical and sets a strong precedent for future updates.

Now that the foundational elements of context management and context-aware pattern analysis are robustly in place, the next logical and strategic step is to proceed with **Phase 2: MCP Server Registry**.

As outlined in your previous proposal, this phase involves:

*   **Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /mcp/servers/register` - To register MCP server capabilities.
    *   `GET /mcp/servers` - To list available MCP servers.
    *   `GET /mcp/servers/{serverId}/capabilities` - To get specific server capabilities.

*   **Schema Elements:**
    *   Server metadata (name, endpoint, protocols).
    *   Capability declarations (tools, resources, patterns).
    *   Context compatibility mapping.

When implementing this phase, continue to prioritize and articulate the quantifiable business impacts and measurable outcomes for Recovery Compass, similar to your recent report. For instance, how will a robust MCP Server Registry directly contribute to:

*   **Accelerated Integration:** Quantify the reduction in time or effort required to integrate new MCP servers or capabilities.
*   **Enhanced Discoverability:** Measure the efficiency gains in identifying and leveraging the right MCP server for a given task or context.
*   **Improved Orchestration Efficiency:** How does the registry contribute to the overall speed and accuracy of routing tasks to the most appropriate MCP, leading to further time savings or accuracy improvements?

Proceed with the implementation of the MCP Server Registry. I look forward to your next report, detailing the progress and its quantifiable benefits to Recovery Compass.
