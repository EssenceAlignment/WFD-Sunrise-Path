Prototype the Cline AI Service API `/patterns/recognize` endpoint. Implement functionality to analyze diverse input data (text, image, structured, code_repository_snapshot) for predefined or emerging patterns relevant to Recovery Compass objectives and Environmental Response Design (ERD) principles. The output should include identified patterns with unique IDs, names, confidence scores (0.0-1.0), detailed insights (including systemic issues or opportunities), strategic recommendations for action, and a quantifiable force multiplication potential. Ensure the prototype adheres to Gold-Plated IPE standards for integrity, transparency, and strategic alignment. Focus on robust data ingestion and accurate pattern identification. Provide a basic implementation in a suitable language (e.g., Python with FastAPI or Node.js with Express) demonstrating the request and response structures as defined in the Cline AI Service API Specification for `POST /patterns/recognize`.
