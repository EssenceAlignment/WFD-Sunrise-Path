Based on the successful implementation of Pattern Recognition and Context Management endpoints, and considering Recovery Compass's strategic goals, I propose the next phase should focus on **Context-Aware Pattern Analysis and MCP Orchestration**.

## Next Phase: Context-Aware Pattern Analysis & MCP Integration

### Strategic Rationale
The current implementation has:
- Pattern recognition capabilities (isolated analysis)
- Context management (environment definitions)

The missing link is **connecting contexts to pattern analysis** to enable:
- Context-specific pattern detection
- MCP server orchestration based on detected patterns
- Force multiplication through context-pattern relationships
- Blind-spot identification across multiple contexts

### Proposed Development Plan

#### Phase 1: Context-Aware Pattern Recognition
**Endpoint: `POST /patterns/analyze`**
- Enhanced version of `/patterns/recognize` that accepts `contextId`
- Analyzes patterns within specific operational contexts
- Returns context-adjusted confidence scores and recommendations

**Key Features:**
- Context-specific pattern libraries
- Environmental factor weighting
- Cross-context pattern correlation

#### Phase 2: MCP Server Registry
**Endpoints:**
- `POST /mcp/servers/register` - Register MCP server capabilities
- `GET /mcp/servers` - List available MCP servers
- `GET /mcp/servers/{serverId}/capabilities` - Get server capabilities

**Schema Elements:**
- Server metadata (name, endpoint, protocols)
- Capability declarations (tools, resources, patterns)
- Context compatibility mapping

#### Phase 3: Orchestration Engine
**Endpoint: `POST /orchestrate/analyze`**
- Accepts input data + contextId
- Performs pattern recognition
- Automatically routes to relevant MCP servers
- Aggregates multi-server responses
- Identifies blind spots and force multiplication opportunities

**Response includes:**
- Primary patterns detected
- MCP server recommendations
- Cross-context insights
- Force multiplication score with actionable steps
- Blind-spot analysis report

#### Phase 4: Force Multiplication Analytics
**Endpoints:**
- `GET /analytics/force-multiplication/{contextId}` - Context-specific FM metrics
- `POST /analytics/compound-value` - Calculate compounding value across contexts
- `GET /analytics/blind-spots` - Identify systemic blind spots

### Implementation Priorities

1. **Context-Pattern Linking** (Week 1)
   - Extend pattern recognition to accept contextId
   - Implement context-aware scoring algorithms
   - Add pattern-to-context mapping storage

2. **MCP Server Integration** (Week 2)
   - Create server registry schema
   - Implement registration/discovery endpoints
   - Add capability matching logic

3. **Orchestration Logic** (Week 3)
   - Build routing engine
   - Implement response aggregation
   - Add blind-spot detection algorithms

4. **Analytics Dashboard** (Week 4)
   - Force multiplication calculations
   - Compound value tracking
   - Blind-spot reporting

### Technical Considerations
- Maintain in-memory storage for prototype
- Use async processing for MCP server calls
- Implement circuit breakers for server failures
- Add comprehensive logging for orchestration decisions

### Gold-Plated IPE Compliance
- Transparent orchestration decisions with audit trails
- Clear documentation of pattern-context relationships
- Metrics on all force multiplication calculations
- Comprehensive error handling with actionable messages

Would you like me to start with the Context-Aware Pattern Recognition enhancement, or would you prefer to focus on a different aspect of this plan?
