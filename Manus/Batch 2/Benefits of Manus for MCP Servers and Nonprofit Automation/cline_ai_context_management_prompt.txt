Develop the Cline AI Service API Context Management Endpoints. Implement `POST /context/create`, `PUT /context/{contextId}`, and `GET /context/{contextId}` as defined in the Cline AI Service API Specification. Ensure the `environmentDefinition` is fully supported within the context model, enabling the definition of systemic environments for environment-shaping solutions. The implementation should adhere to Gold-Plated IPE standards for integrity, transparency, and strategic alignment. Provide a functional implementation in the chosen language (e.g., Python/Node.js), including necessary dependencies, comprehensive documentation, and example API requests for each endpoint. Emphasize how these context management capabilities will influence subsequent pattern recognition and prompt generation, aligning with the "Actualization Map" concept.
