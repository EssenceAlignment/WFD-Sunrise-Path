# Summary of Project Knowledge Files

This document summarizes the content and relationships of the provided project knowledge files, which primarily revolve around the **Recovery Compass** project, focusing on **Airtable integration, pattern recognition, and automation for nonprofit funding and operations**.

## 1. Strategic Overview and Operational Philosophy

*   **RECOVERY_COMPASS_STRATEGIC_INTELLIGENCE_V5.1.md**: This is a foundational document outlining the strategic vision, immutable principles (e.g., Radical Honesty, Intellectual Integrity), and operational philosophy (State of Abundance) for the Recovery Compass project. It details proprietary frameworks like Environmental Response Design™ and Soft Power Philosophy. The document also provides a current status update (End Jul 2025) on key milestones like WFD Demo, Pattern Registry 2.0, React "rc-dashboard" Launcher, and Stripe Integration. A 30-60-90 day roadmap is included, along with advanced protocols, operational standards, mission-critical guardrails, and specifics for Claude Desktop (Apple Silicon) integration, including `rc-dashboard` alias and Arc browser automation.

## 2. Funding Dashboard and Airtable Integration

*   **RC_FUNDING_DASHBOARD_SETUP.md**: This document provides a quick start guide for the `rc-funding` command, which delivers real-time funding intelligence from Airtable. It covers installation, usage examples (web dashboard and terminal versions), a detailed scoring system (Alignment, Urgency, Combined Score), color codes for urgency, and pro tips for daily and weekly use. The data source is explicitly stated as a specific Airtable Base (`appNBesu9xYl5Mvm1`) and Table (`tblcfetlKrhMU4p5r`).

*   **airtable_comprehensive_field_report.md**: This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the fields available in the specified Airtable base and table. It lists all available fields, their types, occurrences, and sample values. It also includes recommendations on which fields can be updated and which to avoid, based on whether they are primary fields or system fields.

*   **airtable_field_inspection_report.md**: A more focused report on Airtable fields, providing a snapshot of available fields, their types, population status, and current values for a sample record. It offers guidance on field selection for AI Pattern annotations and fields to avoid.

## 3. Pattern Recognition and Synchronization with Airtable

*   **PATTERN_REGISTRY_2_IMPLEMENTATION.md**: This is a critical document detailing the successful implementation of Pattern Registry 2.0, described as the 


“sensing fabric” for Recovery Compass. It outlines the 5 core files created, the total number of patterns (36 across funding, donor, and operations domains), and how all four executive caveats (Shadow Mode, Domain Data-Source Whitelisting, Pattern Efficacy Test Suite, Soft Rollback Hook) have been addressed. It highlights the force multiplication achieved (e.g., 6x pattern coverage, 7x faster MCP integration time) and immediate capabilities unlocked in funding, donor, and operations domains. Next steps include 48-hour shadow mode observation, test suite implementation, and MCP server scaffolding.

*   **PATTERN_REGISTRY_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md**: This report certifies that Pattern Registry 2.0 is operational and ready for shadow mode observation. It provides verification evidence for shadow mode validation, baseline metrics measurement, integration testing, and preview validation. It also confirms IPE compliance and details the enhanced files (`supervisor/cascade_governor.py` and `scripts/pattern_collector.py`) and verification commands. Caveat compliance status for C-1, C-2, C-3, and C-4 is verified, and force multiplication metrics are presented. It outlines a 48-hour plan for initial observation, validation, tuning, and activation decision.

*   **airtable_pattern_verification_report.md**: This report summarizes the verification of AI patterns in Airtable, showing that out of 62 records checked, 46 have AI patterns. It lists specific records with AI pattern updates, indicating whether patterns were found in the 'Notes' and 'External API ID' fields.

*   **PATTERN_AIRTABLE_SYNC_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: This document provides instructions for the `pattern_to_airtable_sync.py` script, which makes Pattern Registry 2.0 detections visible in Airtable. It details how to run the script, what to expect during execution, and how to verify changes in Airtable by checking the 'Notes', 'Priority Score', and 'External API ID' fields. It also includes important notes on persistence, provenance, non-destructive updates, and idempotency, emphasizing that the implementation is not complete until user confirmation.

*   **pattern_sync_verification.txt**: A simple text file confirming the pattern to Airtable sync, showing the timestamp, number of records analyzed, and records updated. It also reminds the user to check specific fields in Airtable for verification.

## 4. Agent Activation System

*   **GOLD_PLATED_AGENT_ACTIVATION_COMPLETE.md**: This document describes the completion of the Gold-Plated Agent Activation System for Claude Code Agents. It summarizes the implementation of an Agent Activation Template, a Dynamic Activation Generator, and updated context files. Test results show a successful activation response with loaded agents, visible guardrails (e.g., ≤5 files, ≤100 LOC), and real-time KPIs (MTTR, Success Rate, Errors). It outlines usage instructions, confirms Gold-Plated Compliance, and details next steps for deployment, monitoring, and refinement. The document emphasizes the force multiplication impact of this system, transforming agent activation into a “precision contract establishment.”

## Conclusion

These documents collectively describe a sophisticated system for managing and automating nonprofit operations, particularly in the context of funding and grant management. The **Recovery Compass** project leverages **Airtable** as a central data source, integrates with a powerful **Pattern Registry 2.0** for AI-driven insights, and utilizes a **Gold-Plated Agent Activation System** for autonomous task execution. The emphasis is on efficiency, data-driven decision-making, and strategic automation to maximize impact for nonprofit organizations.
