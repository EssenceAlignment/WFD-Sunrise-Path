# SAM.gov Role Selection Guide for Grant Applications

## 🎯 For Grant Applications, Select:

### **Entity Registration → Data Entry** ✅

This role allows you to:
- Update your organization's registration
- Maintain entity information
- Manage certifications and representations
- **Required for federal grant applications**

## 📋 Role Explanations:

### Entity Reporting
- **Data Entry**: Submit reports required by federal agencies
- Not needed initially for grants

### Contract Opportunities  
- **Data Entry**: Respond to federal contracts
- **Viewer**: Search contract opportunities
- Not needed for grants (this is for contractors, not grantees)

### Entity Registration ✅ 
- **Data Entry**: Edit your organization's SAM profile
- **Viewer**: View your registration details
- **ESSENTIAL for grant applications**

## 🚀 Recommended Action:

1. **Select**: Entity Registration → Data Entry
2. **Skip other roles** for now (you can add later if needed)
3. **Complete** your entity registration first

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

- This step is **OPTIONAL** during initial registration
- You can **skip it now** and request roles later
- If you don't have an Entity ID (UEI) yet, **skip this step**
- You'll get your UEI during the registration process

## 💡 Pro Tip:

If this is your FIRST TIME registering:
1. **Skip the role request** 
2. Complete your entity registration
3. Get your UEI
4. THEN come back and request "Entity Registration - Data Entry" role

## 🎯 For Grant Seekers Specifically:

You'll eventually need:
- **Entity Registration - Data Entry** (in SAM.gov)
- **Authorized Organization Representative (AOR)** role (in Grants.gov)

The AOR role in Grants.gov is what allows you to submit grant applications, not SAM.gov roles.

---

**Bottom Line**: Select "Entity Registration - Data Entry" if you already have a UEI, or skip this step if you're registering for the first time.
