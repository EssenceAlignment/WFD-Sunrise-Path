    <div class="article">
        I, JUDY BRAKEBILL JONES, a resident of Santa Clara County, California, being of sound and disposing mind and memory, and not acting under duress, menace, fraud, or undue influence of any person whomsoever, do make, publish, and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, and I hereby expressly revoke all wills and codicils heretofore made by me.
    </div>

    <div class="article">

        I declare that I am unmarried. I have the following children: LAWRENCE ELLIOT LASHER, ERIC BRAKEBILL JONES, HEIDI MARICHEN JONES BLANCHARD, and GRETCHEN ANGELA JONES. I have no deceased children leaving issue surviving.
    </div>

    <div class="article">

    <div class="article">
        <div class="article-header">ARTICLE THIRD</div>
        I direct that all inheritance, estate, and succession taxes (including interest and penalties thereon) payable by reason of my death shall be paid out of and be charged generally against the principal of my residuary estate without reimbursement from any person.
    </div>

    <div class="article">
        <div class="article-header">ARTICLE FOURTH</div>
        I give, devise, and bequeath all of my estate, real, personal, and mixed, of whatsoever kind and nature and wheresoever situated, of which I may die seized or possessed, or in which I may have any interest or over which I may have any power of appointment or testamentary disposition, to the then acting Trustee of the JUDY BRAKEBILL JONES 2008 REVOCABLE TRUST, created by me as Trustor, to be added to, administered, and distributed as part of said Trust, and in accordance with the terms of said Trust and any amendments thereto made prior to my death.
    </div>

    <div class="article">
        <div class="article-header">ARTICLE FIFTH</div>
        If the foregoing disposition to the Trustee of the JUDY BRAKEBILL JONES 2008 REVOCABLE TRUST should fail or be declared invalid for any reason, or if said Trust fails or has been revoked, I hereby incorporate by reference the terms of said Trust as executed on the date thereof, and any amendments thereto made prior to my death, and I direct that my estate be administered and distributed in accordance with the terms and provisions of said Trust, which shall be deemed to constitute a testamentary trust created under this Will.

        <div class="article-header">ARTICLE SIXTH</div>
        I nominate as Co-Executors of this Will, my son, ERIC BRAKEBILL JONES, and my daughter, HEIDI JONES BLANCHARD, to serve without bond. If either of them should fail or cease to act, the remaining Co-Executor shall serve as sole Executor. I grant to my Executors full power and authority to sell, lease, mortgage, or otherwise deal with any real or personal property belonging to my estate, without court order and without notice to anyone.
    </div>

    <div class="article">
        <div class="article-header">ARTICLE SEVENTH</div>
        I have intentionally and with full knowledge omitted to provide for any heirs I may have, whether now living or hereafter born or adopted, except as specifically provided for herein.
    </div>

    <div class="article">
        <div class="article-header">ARTICLE EIGHTH</div>
        If any beneficiary under this Will or any trust created hereunder contests or attacks this Will or any of its provisions, any share or interest in my estate given to that contesting beneficiary under this Will is revoked and shall be disposed of in the same manner as if that contesting beneficiary had predeceased me.
