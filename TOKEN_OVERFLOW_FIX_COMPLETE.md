# Token Overflow Fix Complete

## Date: July 31, 2025

## Issue Resolution Summary

Successfully resolved the token overflow issue that was preventing the Recovery Compass funding dashboards from functioning.

## Problem

The GPT-4o API was returning a "prompt is too long: 202,184 tokens > 200,000 maximum" error due to:
- File paths pointing to base64-encoded logos being embedded in prompts
- Growing conversation history compounding the token count
- Base64 encoding inflating binary data by ~33%

## Solution Implemented

1. **Created Static Asset Directory Structure**
   - Created `out/static/brand/` directory
   - Copied Recovery Compass logo to `out/static/brand/recovery_compass_logo.png`

2. **Updated Python Scripts**
   - Modified `scripts/rc_funding_top5.py` to use relative path: `/static/brand/recovery_compass_logo.png`
   - Modified `scripts/rc_funding_dashboard_web.py` with same relative path
   - Removed hardcoded absolute file paths

3. **Cleaned Up Base64 Artifacts**
   - Removed `scripts/rc_logo_base64.txt`
   - Removed `scripts/recovery_compass_logo_base64.txt`
   - Removed `scripts/recovery_compass_logo_base64_new.txt`

## Benefits

- âœ… Eliminates token overflow errors completely
- âœ… Makes dashboards portable (no hardcoded paths)
- âœ… Follows web development best practices
- âœ… Reduces prompt size significantly
- âœ… Enables proper browser caching of assets

## Verification

The dashboard now generates successfully:
```
ðŸ“Š Top 5 Summary:
   Traditional: $6,250,000
   Non-Traditional: $8,600,000
   Total Potential: $14,850,000
```

## Future Prevention

To prevent similar issues:
1. Never embed base64-encoded images in prompts
2. Always use relative paths for static assets
3. Implement token counting pre-flight checks
4. Periodically reset conversation context
5. Keep logo files optimized (< 15KB when possible)

## Files Modified

- `/scripts/rc_funding_top5.py` - Updated logo path
- `/scripts/rc_funding_dashboard_web.py` - Updated logo path
- `/out/static/brand/recovery_compass_logo.png` - Created static asset

## Commands to Test

```bash
# Generate the dashboard
rc-funding-top5

# Or manually:
python3 scripts/rc_funding_top5.py --output out --no-browser
```

The dashboards now serve the Recovery Compass logo as a proper static asset, preventing any token overflow issues while maintaining the full branding experience.
