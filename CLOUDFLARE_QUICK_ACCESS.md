# üöÄ CLOUDFLARE QUICK ACCESS GUIDE - NO TOOLS REQUIRED

## ‚úÖ OAuth Loop is FIXED!
All Cloudflare MCP processes have been terminated. You can now access Cloudflare directly.

## üåê Option 1: Cloudflare Dashboard (Easiest)
Simply go to: **https://dash.cloudflare.com**

### Key Sections:
- **Workers & Pages**: https://dash.cloudflare.com/workers
- **Your Domains**: https://dash.cloudflare.com (main dashboard)
- **Turnstile (CAPTCHA)**: https://dash.cloudflare.com/turnstile
- **AI Gateway**: https://dash.cloudflare.com/ai
- **Analytics**: https://dash.cloudflare.com/analytics

### Managing Worker Secrets:
1. Go to Workers & Pages
2. Click on your Worker
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Variables
4. Add your environment variables/secrets

## üîë Option 2: Direct API Access (No CLI Required)

### Get Your API Token:
```bash
# Your token is stored securely in macOS Keychain
security find-generic-password -s "recovery-compass-cf-token" -w
```

### Example API Commands:

#### List Your Zones (Domains):
```bash
export CF_TOKEN=$(security find-generic-password -s "recovery-compass-cf-token" -w)
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq
```

#### List Your Workers:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/workers/scripts" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq
```

#### Get Zone Details (Your Specific Zone):
```bash
export CF_ZONE_ID=$(security find-generic-password -s "recovery-compass-cf-zone-id" -w)
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$CF_ZONE_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq
```

## üì± Option 3: Cloudflare Mobile App
Download the Cloudflare app on your phone for quick access on the go.

## üéØ Your Recovery Compass Cloudflare Resources

Based on your deployment, you likely have:
1. **Worker/Pages for API endpoints**
2. **Turnstile for bot protection**
3. **AI Gateway for LLM usage**
4. **DNS records for your domains**

## üö® IMPORTANT: Never Use Cloudflare MCP Server Again

The MCP server that caused the OAuth loop should NEVER be added back. Your current clean MCP config with only filesystem and memory servers is perfect.
